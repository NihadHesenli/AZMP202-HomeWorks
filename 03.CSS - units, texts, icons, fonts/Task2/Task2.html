            <p>I've been playing guitar for about 2 years. I write metal music, especially nu-metal genre songs . I also know how to work with equipment and sound, and I also know how to work with a band. I performed with some bands, one of them was my band named Reddol which created with my friends. I performed with a local underground bands and once with the group ZARAZZA(my band was a oppener of a concert). I have a good understanding of music theory, you can also look at my activities on social meadia.</p>
